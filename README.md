# pypi-stats-timeline
Fetch and maintain timelines of downloads from pypi. Query your data offline.

This uses the [pypi stats api](https://pypistats.org/api/). There is a library called [pypistats](https://github.com/hugovk/pypistats) provided by PyPI stats which queries this API but does not provide timeline data. Perhaps if this project is broadly used the author of that package will merge these features.
